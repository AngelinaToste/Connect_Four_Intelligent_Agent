This README file describes the difference between the gameBoard.java 
and commandLineGameBoardRevised.java files.

gameBoard.java
The gameBoard.java file is the original file with the java 
swing GUI that was displayed first in the presentation video.

commandLineGameBoardRevised.java
This was the second program displayed at the end of the presentation.
In the event that there were any errors in the GUI file, a 
command line version of the game has been supplied as 
commandLineGameBoardRevised.java. This program uses almost 
exactly the same code as gameBoard.java but it has the command
line for user interaction implemented instead of the swing GUI.
